        On the navbar, there will be a Blogs route. This will be an open route
        (anyone visiting your website will see it). You will have to answer all
        the questions, and they are 13.1 What are the different ways to manage a
        state in a React application? 13.2 How does prototypical inheritance
        work? 13.3 What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests? 13.4
        React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
      </p>
    </div>
